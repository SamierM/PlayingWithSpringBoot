The purpose of this repo is to contain the items I create to play around with Spring Boot. I will work with a couple of toy projects to understand the fundamentals to create business level distributed systems.

I am following along the guides and tutorials from the springboot.io website for those who wish to follow along.

Installation:

-Tomcat
	-1H 2021: 
	Tomcat 10 does not work with Spring 5 so these instructions are to install Tomcat 9 until that issue is resolved by the Spring team.

	1. Download Tomcat: tomcat.apache.org
	2. Navigate to Tomcat 9 downloads and find the binary distributions
	3. Select the appropriate core distribution for your OS
	4. Run the installer and install the full set of components
		-use any name fo username and admin password
	5. Run Tomcat
